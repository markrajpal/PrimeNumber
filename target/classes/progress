Changes:
Got an implementation working completely written in Java with 1 class and 1 test class.
It uses the traditional method of finding a prime.
What works?
In milliseconds it can determine the smallest 10 digit prime.
What doesn't work?
After, 6 hours it has yet to find the smallest 11 digit prime.

06/02/2019
Changes:
Improved the prime determination to include the sum of digits divisible by 3
What works?

What's next?
Add log4j logging

06/03/2019
Changes:
none
What works?
It took about 24 hours but it got through 1000 concurrent threads
What doesn't work?

What's next?
Add log4j logging

Changes:

What works?
Seems to be getting through the next increments of 1000 threads much faster.
After 48 hours it got through 10,000 threads.
What doesn't work?
same
What's next?
Add log4j logging
Move the 11 digit prime test to an Integration Test class
Support for an actual start position so we don't have to start over everytime

06/23/2019
Changes:
Fixed the broken unit tests
Fixed a bug in isPrime where counter somehow gets below 0
What works?
same
What doesn't work?
After 2 weeks, still unable to figure out the 11 digit prime
What's next?
Research what the 11 digit prime actually is
-DONE

Add log4j logging
Move the 11 digit prime test to an Integration Test class
-DONE
Support for an actual start position so we don't have to start over everytime
Log the date/time
Switch to euclidean division

06/24/2019
Changes:
-checked to make sure all previous potential primes were checked when a prime is found
-Moved the isPrime method to the Runnable class
What works?
-11 & 12 digit
-11 digit takes 23 seconds
-12 digit takes 1m 22 seconds
What doesn't work?
-Even though 10 concurrent threads work well, 100 & 1000 don't work well
-It went bonkers when I tried 100 zeroes
What's next?
Add log4j logging
Support for an actual start position so we don't have to start over everytime
Log the date/time
Switch to euclidean division

06/25/2019
Changes:
-Runnable to Thread
What works?
-11 digit takes 1m 18s (I think I had this at 23s only once when isPrime was in the Prime class)
What doesn't work?
-Even though 10 concurrent threads work well, 1000 doesn't work
What's next?
Add log4j logging
Support for an actual start position so we don't have to start over everytime

Doubles are presenting a major problem.
-It seems when you add a small number to a really large number, there is no effect.
-Need to convert all doubles to BigIntegers, but there is a risk that we may hit the upper limit real fast.

07/05/2019
Changes:
-double --> BigInteger
-setup GitHub
What works?
-The 11 & 12 digit tests run in under 2 seconds, WOW

07/08/2019
After running the 100 digit test for a few days it is evident I need to incorporate a new primality test
